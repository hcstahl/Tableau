# Gantt Chart


# Population Pyramid
The column fields holds two types of continious variables.</br>
A good example would be Female,Male or Adult,Child.</br>
The row field holds a discrete variable that is used to measure going down the chart.</br>
The type of chart is a bar, but the second column field is reversed to create the population pyramid look.</br>
To do this, right click the axis area and undernath the Scale header click reverse.</br>
The parameter is linked to the row field so the user can control the difference in years that is shown.</br>

2. Put the Axis field as a second column field.</br>
3. Make the Axis field a shape type.</br>
