# Gantt Chart


# Population Pyramid
The column fields holds two types of continious variables.
A good example would be Female,Male or Adult,Child.
The row field holds a discrete variable that is used to measure going down the chart.
The type of chart is a bar, but the second column field is reversed to create the population pyramid look.
To do this, right click the axis area and undernath the Scale header click reverse.
The parameter is linked to the row field so the user can control the difference in years that is shown.

# Bar Chart with KPI indicator
This includes an Arrow on the bar chart indicating by color whether a performance target was met or not.
In this example the Arrow turns Red, and the amount dissapers if it fails to meet the target.
